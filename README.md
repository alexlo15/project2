## Motivation
We wanted to design a free resource where other individuals learning how to code can practice their coding terminology. Our website uses study materials such as flashcards and quizzes in order for users to hone their skills.

## Technologies used and why

**Built with:**
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/):
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/?from=io):

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): An environment that allows developers to use Javascript to interact with the user without front-end coding.
* [MySQL2](https://www.mysql.com/): Open source database that allows developers to create databases.
* [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Set environment variables to the global `process.env` object in node.
